## Pull Request Guidelines

**Important**: Please note our branching strategy:
- `master` branch is for development towards 0.5.0
- `0.4.x` branch is for stable 0.4.x releases and bug fixes

**If you're submitting a bug fix for the stable release:**
- Target the `0.4.x` branch
- Bug fixes will be cherry-picked to `master` if needed

**If you're submitting a new feature:**
- Target the `master` branch

**Please do not create PRs from `0.4.x` to `master`** - this goes against our release workflow.
