Patchutils news
---------------

0.4.4 (stable)

	Enhanced Git diff format support in filterdiff/lsdiff/grepdiff.
	Improved handling of Git diffs without traditional hunks,
	including proper support for file renames, binary file changes,
	and permission mode changes. Fixed exclusion filtering (-x) for
	multi-file Git diffs to prevent orphaned headers. Enhanced filename
	extraction to properly strip Git's a/ and b/ prefixes for consistent
	output. Addresses GitHub issues #22, #27, #57, and #59.

	Code improvements and build system enhancements. Added redirectfd()
	utility function to redirect stdout without reassignment. Enhanced
	CI testing with musl support for better compatibility testing.
	Fixed bash completion symlinks for better installation. Made
	grepdiff test case PCRE-aware to handle different regex library
	configurations properly. Addresses GitHub issues #61, #91, and #93.
	Updated spec file.

	Added manual pages for gitdiff, gitdiffview, svndiff, and svndiffview
	commands. Addresses GitHub issue #112.

0.4.3 (stable)

	Added --in-place option to more tools for editing files in place.
	Added --color option to interdiff with automatic terminal detection.
	Improved PCRE2 support and fixed various build issues. Added support
	for CRLF line endings in patch files. Fixed interdiff to reverse line
	counts correctly when reversing patches. Added bash completions and
	improved CI testing. Various bug fixes including use-after-free
	warnings, unused result warnings, and locale-related test failures.
	Updated documentation and example spec file.

	Added new --as-numbered-lines options: original-before and original-after.
	These preserve original line numbers from the diff context, useful for
	CI/CD systems that need to report errors on exact line numbers from the
	original diff. Addresses GitHub issue #55.

	Fixed rediff to preserve diff command headers in multi-file patches.
	Previously, rediff would remove "diff -rpU 3" command lines when
	processing patches with multiple files, breaking the patch format.
	Addresses GitHub issue #48.

	Fixed recountdiff corruption of new file headers when git signature
	lines are present. Previously, recountdiff would incorrectly change
	"@@ -0,0 +1,N @@" to "@@ -1 +1,N @@" for new files in patches containing
	git signature lines (e.g., "-- \n2.50.1"), causing patch application
	to fail. Addresses GitHub issue #49.

0.4.2 (stable)

	Build system improvements: only run xmlto once during documentation
	generation.

0.4.0 (stable)

	Added patchview utility for interactive patch viewing. Added PCRE2
	library support as an alternative to PCRE. Added --only-match option
	to grepdiff. Improved interdiff to provide more context when requested
	and better handle whitespace damage. Fixed various issues including
	hunk trimming, header output, context conversion, and handling of NUL
	characters in patches. Updated FSF addresses and fixed resource leaks.
	Improved test suite with parallel testing support.

0.3.4 (stable)

	Some fixes for filterdiff and rediff. The splitdiff utility
	now has an option to write output to a subdirectory. Ranges
	can now be prefixed by a modifier ('x') to exclude spans
	instead of include them. Extended headers produced by git are
        now handled by filterdiff and interdiff.

0.3.3 (stable)

	Context output format for "no newline" lines has been fixed.
	The splitdiff utility now has an option to disable ".patch"
	filename extensions. Some fixes for bugs spotted by
	Coverity. Interdiff can now use "-" (stdin) for one of the
	inputs.

0.3.2 (stable)

	Interdiff had previously been putting absolute filenames in
	the input to the patch program.  It now avoids doing this.
	Editdiff no longer runs rediff when no changes were made in
	the editor.  The correct exit status is now set when the
	decompress option fails.  A temporary file leak has been
	fixed.  The documentation has been updated.

0.3.0 (stable)

	The lsdiff -H option is now the default, and new options have
	been added to filterdiff for reading inclusion/exclusion
	patterns from files, and for removing non-diff lines.
