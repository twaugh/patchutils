So what is patchview? It is a wrapper of filterdiff for use with numbered files.

    $ patchview
    (without args)
    
is equivalent to: lsdiff --number

    $ patchview -F2-
    (or with any other args)
    
is equivalent to: filterdiff -F2- (or whatever arguments are supplied)

There are 4 scripts for working with git (gitdiff, gitdiffview, gitshow and gitshowview) and two for svn (svndiff and svndiffview).
Also these scripts have option -v which shows the full command that is which is being executed.


    $ svndiff
    $ gitdiff
    (without args)
    
will give the list of files modified

    $ svndiff -F1
    $ gitdiff -F1
    
will show the patch of file #1

    $ svndiffview
    $ gitdiffview
    
pipe all patches through filterdiff to `vim - -R` (in read-only mode, easy to quit), showing complete patch with color.

    $ svndiffview -F2
    $ gitdiffview -F2
    (or any other args)

will pipe patch of file #2 to `vim - -R`

gitshow and gitshowview instead use git diff, use git show .


Example:
We can make the following one-line script with the name difftotrunk.sh, to view the differences of two directories or svn repos (trunk and .)

    diff ../trunk . -ru -x .svn | patchview "$@"

    $ ./difftotrunk.sh , will show all different files and his number.
    $ ./difftotrunk.sh -F3,4 , will show the differences of files #3 and #4 only.
    $ ./difftotrunk.sh -F3 -#1, will show only hunk #1 of file #3.
    $ ./difftotrunk.sh -F3 -#x1, will show the differences of files #3 without hunk #1 (x means that exclude).
